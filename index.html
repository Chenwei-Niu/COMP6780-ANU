            <p>Hello, my name is Chenwei Niu, a new student in Master of Computing (advanced) in ANU.
                I am enthusiastic in programming and driving cars. Excepting develop programs,
                driving cars should be my first passion. Thatâ€™s why after I graduated from the University of Melbourne,
                I went to a company as an embedded software engineer developing the MCU software for several electrical cars in China. </p>
            <p>Electric cars will no doubt gradually and completely replace fuel cars over the next 20-30 years.
                This is because electricity is both a renewable and clean source of energy. In addition to this,
                electric cars also have more horsepower and acceleration because they are not tied to a gearbox.
                As tempting as the smooth handling and power of an electric car is,
                I'm still more obsessed with driving a conventional car.
                The reason is that the handling feel of a conventional fuel car is made up of the engine and gearbox
                and the tuning of the car manufacturer. This unique feeling cannot be simulated by an electric motor.</p>
            <p>Both manual and automatic cars have shift operations, via gear levers or shift paddles.
                When you downshift to make up the gas and depress the accelerator pedal,
                the car revs up, and you feel a strong pushback. Then find the right moment to up-shift.
                This whole process is the feeling of operation that a conventional car can give.
                When I was in China, I used to drive my car on mountain roads because they have more curves which
                practicing the driving skills.</p>
            <p>Apart from that, the most significant reason that driving has become one of my greatest passions is that
                it allows me to forget about my worries in life and concentrate on the road in front of me.
                This is one of the few precious moments of solitude and exactly what every adult needs.</p>
