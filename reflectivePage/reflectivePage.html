        <p>I have learnt a lot from this project. I think the most important thing I learned is to design the UI well in advance before coding. I didn't design my site layout properly at the beginning, so my CSS files were not designed and coded properly. There were a lot of duplicate codes. If it had been designed properly in advance, then many of the class tags could have been reused.</p>
        <p>In addition to this, when coding the alternative CSS file for my site, I found that my CSS was not split into many files based on categories, which made writing alternative CSS a little difficult.</p>
        <p>Also I understand the key role of UI design, if my website design and artwork is not impressive, then my website will be no different from a website made with a template like WorkPress.</p>
        <p>I also learned to adapt different CSS to the change of screen size, although I don't have this feature on my current site, it is still necessary for a good user experience. User experience is essential in website design and human machine interaction.</p>
        <p>The last thing I learned is that I can control the information display area in the middle of my webpage to show different content via javascript. If I did in this way, I don't have to copy and paste the navigation bar code all the time, which also reduces the lines of duplicate code.</p>
